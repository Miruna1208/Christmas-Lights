# Christmas Lights ðŸŽ„

An Arduino-based project that controls decorative Christmas lights with custom patterns and effects. The project demonstrates how to use microcontrollers to create festive light animations, combining hardware (LEDs, resistors, Arduino board) and software (timing loops, sequences, effects).

## Features
- Multiple LED patterns (blinking, chasing, wave effects)  
- Adjustable speed and sequences  
- Simple and low-cost circuit  
- Expandable design for larger light setups  

## Components
- Arduino UNO 
- LEDs (any colors, arranged in decorative setup)  
- Current-limiting resistors  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  
- USB cable for programming and power

## Code
The implementation is written in **C++ for Arduino**.  
You can find the full source code in the repository under `Christmas Lights.ino`.  

## How It Works
1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.  
2. Connect the LEDs according to the defined pins in the code.  
3. The program cycles through predefined light patterns.  
4. Adjust delays or add new patterns in the `.ino` file to customize your own effects.
